# AE-Course-Project

Traffic management is a crucial aspect of modern transportation systems. This project presents an Arduino-based traffic system that utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect vehicles, LEDs for traffic signal indication, and seven-segment displays to measure and display distances. The system is designed to enhance road safety by implementing dynamic signal control.
